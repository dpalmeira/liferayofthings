# Liferay Audience Targeting Rules

Rules enable Audience Targeting administrators to define how users are
classified into the user segments they create.

Basically, a rule evaluates if the current user matches or not one or several
conditions. Rules can be configured and combined differently for each user
segment to create a very specific classification algorithm. A user must match
all rules in a user segment to be classified into it.

## Behavior Rules

These rules allow to classify users based on their navigation behavior.

These rules will not work properly if content tracking or page tracking are not
enabled. They can be enabled in Control Panel > Portal Settings >
Audience Targeting Analytics (for portal level configuration) or in
Control Panel > Site Settings > Audience Targeting Analytics (for site level
configuration).

### Content Visited

Evaluates if the user has visited the selected content.

### Page Visited

Evaluates if the user has visited the selected page.

### Score Points

Evaluates if the user has visited any page or content categorized under this
user segment a number of times equals or higher than the configured threshold.

## Social Rules

These rules allow to classify users based on their profiles in social networks
(e.g. Facebook).

These rules will not work properly if login through the specific social network
(Single Sign On) is not enabled and properly configured. Follow these steps to
enable Facebook Sigle Sign on in Liferay:

1. Sign in to the [Facebook Developers site](https://developers.facebook.com)
and add a new App. For more information, read the [Facebook app developer guide]
(https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/appcenter). After going through all
the steps, you will finally have a new App with an Application ID and an
Application Secret.

2. Log in as a Portal administrator in your Liferay Portal and go to
Control Panel > Portal Settings > Authentication > Facebook. Check Enable and
copy your Application ID and Application Secret to their respective fields.
Finally click Save.

3. To verify that the Facebook Single Sign On works properly, sign out and then
click the Facebook option in the Sign In box. Enter your Facebook username and
password in the prompted pop-up and click Login. You should be automatically
signed in to your Liferay Portal with your Facebook user.
